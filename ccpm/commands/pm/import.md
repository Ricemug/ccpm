# Import

Import existing forge issues into the PM system.

## Usage
```
/pm:import [--epic <epic_name>] [--label <label>]
```

Options:
- `--epic` - Import into specific epic
- `--label` - Import only issues with specific label
- No args - Import all untracked issues

## Instructions

### 0. Initialize Forge Abstraction

```bash
source .claude/scripts/forge/config.sh
forge_init || exit 1
```

### 1. Fetch Forge Issues

```bash
# Use forge abstraction to get issues
source .claude/scripts/forge/issue-list.sh

# Get issues based on filters
if [[ "$ARGUMENTS" == *"--label"* ]]; then
  # Note: Filtering by label may need platform-specific handling
  forge_issue_list --state all
else
  forge_issue_list --state all
fi
```

Note: Label filtering and JSON output may require platform-specific handling.

### 2. Identify Untracked Issues

For each GitHub issue:
- Search local files for matching github URL
- If not found, it's untracked and needs import

### 3. Categorize Issues

Based on labels:
- Issues with "epic" label â†’ Create epic structure
- Issues with "task" label â†’ Create task in appropriate epic
- Issues with "epic:{name}" label â†’ Assign to that epic
- No PM labels â†’ Ask user or create in "imported" epic

### 4. Create Local Structure

For each issue to import:

**If Epic:**
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/epics/{epic_name}
# Create epic.md with GitHub content and frontmatter
```

**If Task:**
```bash
# Find next available number (001.md, 002.md, etc.)
# Create task file with GitHub content
```

Set frontmatter:
```yaml
name: {issue_title}
status: {open|closed based on GitHub}
created: {GitHub createdAt}
updated: {GitHub updatedAt}
github: https://github.com/{org}/{repo}/issues/{number}
imported: true
```

### 5. Output

```
ðŸ“¥ Import Complete

Imported:
  Epics: {count}
  Tasks: {count}
  
Created structure:
  {epic_1}/
    - {count} tasks
  {epic_2}/
    - {count} tasks
    
Skipped (already tracked): {count}

Next steps:
  Run /pm:status to see imported work
  Run /pm:sync to ensure full synchronization
```

## Important Notes

Preserve all GitHub metadata in frontmatter.
Mark imported files with `imported: true` flag.
Don't overwrite existing local files.
